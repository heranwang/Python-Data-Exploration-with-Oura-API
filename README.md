# Simple Data Visualization with Oura Ring API

In this repository, I used Python (Jupyter Notebook) to pull my own OURA ring sleep data over the last few months via my OURA cloud account (by way of API token).

The repository currently contains two files: one demonstrating the data pulling process and some basic visualization, and the other some basic correlations found within the data. (coming soon)
