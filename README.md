# Simple Data Visualization with Oura Ring API

In this repository, I used Python (Jupyter Notebook) to pull my own OURA ring sleep data over the last few months via my OURA cloud account (by way of API token).

Coding scripts contained in the repository:

1. Data ETL process and some basic visualization with general sleep data via Oura Developer API
2. Basic data science with correlations visualiations with a more detailed sleep dataset
